# Tweetscape Product Update, 06/24/2022

[Earlier this week](https://tweetscape.co/blog/rpg-vs-research), I shared that our new teammates Ricardo and Julian were scheduled to run a product workshop with the team to help us zero in on a specific product vision.

* The good news: the product workshop happened! 
* The bad news: we were overly ambitious in what the team could get done in two hours. 

Today, I’m going to share the output from the workshop so far. We are pretty much at halftime, which is a great time for a live update. 

## Starting From Personas
In [exploring user segments](https://tweetscape.co/blog/rpg-vs-research), I introduced two broad categories of users.

1. RPG ([Role Playing Game](https://twitter.com/visakanv/status/1094684057173016581)) players 
2. Research-Driven users. 

The main distinction between them is that RPG players are engagement driven, while Research-Driven users are information driven. Despite that core difference, there is a lot of overlap between their frustrations. 

As our team went deeper, we found even more overlap in subcategories. For example, Research-Driven users fall into 2 categories 

1. Analysts 
2. Deep Thinkers 

Analysts are focused on timely information discovery for specific topics. Meanwhile, Deep Thinkers are looking to expand their horizons and improve their information diet. Their motivations are different, but this venn diagram of quotes/concepts from exploratory interviews shows many frustrations they share:

    <em>analysts vs deep thinkers</em>
</p>

This is similar to the venn diagram between [RPG players and Research-Driven](https://tweetscape.co/blog/rpg-vs-research). Despite a wide range of motivations among different personas, many of the problems have the same roots. 

### Lack of Agency
When looking at the overall customer needs, a general pattern is the desire for more control over the feed and an ability to see how content and communities interrelate. Lack of control creates the feeling of a **lack of agency**, which leads to an anxious experience where people aren’t sure when to stop, where to look, or if they are finding the best content, accounts, and projects they could be. They know that twitter can be powerful. They see other people using it as a powerful tool, but their own experience is a struggle against spam and distraction.

## Personas → Jobs To Be Done (Reframing Problems) 
Because of the apparent overlap in the problems of the deep thinker, analyst, and RPG player archetypes, we decided to move towards a [Jobs-to-be-Done Framework](https://jtbd.info/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27) and evaluate the user needs more holistically so that we can later-on select “jobs to be done” that we want to focus on.
Here is a table of some jobs to be done we discovered so far:

## How Might We…  
Next, we took the problems from above and wrote “How might we…” questions to point at possible solutions. Here is a list of the how might we's split up by the problems/goals shared in the table above.

#### I want to get updates about the projects I care about
* how might we remove the burden that analysts have about not knowing if they are missing out on important information?
* how might we design an experience that better matches the user's research questions and mental models?
* how might we pick up important news and discussions related to the projects/topics are interested in?


#### I want to find new projects/entities that I should be paying attention to
* how might we surface important new entities in different spaces?
how can we help analysts/writers by signalling projects that are gained attention within the last month?

#### I want to spot trends and events that can influence things I care about
* how might we enable thinkers to better track how things evolve over time?
* how might we allow users to better make connections between different events?
* how might we enable a higher level of thinking by allowing users to pick up on larger patterns

#### I want to tune in and out of different conversations to find new perspectives about a topic/group of people
* how might we better surface clusters of people interested in the same topics?
* how might we facilitate users interested in learning more about topic x to better find a community that discusses those topics?
* how might we help users navigate new topics/communities without the work of list building or methodically following/unfollowing 


#### I want to find ideas, articles, opinions that help me progress my thinking on a topic
* how might we transition from being caught up in the moment to having more depth
* how might we move away from being up to date on things you were consuming to have more time to spend more time on good quality

#### I want to have more agency over my information consumption.
* how might we make Twitter a more calm experience?
* how might we enable users to more selectively filter their streams?
* how might we make Twitter less addictive? (to allow me to immerse myself in the ideas/wisdom)

#### I want to increase the engagement with my account and gain social capital in a community.* 
* how might we facilitate users to build relationships with other engaged users
* how might we enable users to find others who are willing to engage, or are active and willing to exchange ideas?

#### I want to find others I can learn from and with.
* how might we make it easier to understand what a person talks about (what you will potentially learn from them?)
* how might we find clusters of people learning from each other?
* how might we make it easier to find people learning the same topics as you?

## Building Blocks
The next question for our team is: how might we take all of our "how might we’s" and configure them into compelling product offerings. 

This was the point in the workshop when we realized that we didn’t give ourselves enough time to fully complete the workshop, but we did start to put together some interesting groupings.

The work I show here is a very much a work in progress and something the team as a whole will refine in the second half of the workshop. 

Part of that refinement will be rating each of these product offering configurations based on the following factors:
* why would a certain persona be excited?
* technical feasibility (we can build a poc?)
* viability (customer base) - how many users are out there?
* willingness to pay
* ability to impact

#### How might we tune in/tune out of twitter

#### Analysis and Discovery and/or Source Reliability

#### Active Learners

#### Improve Focus

#### More Exploratory Clusters

### Wrapping Up
There is much more analysis to be shared about each of those groupings, but I will save that for a deeper post next week.

## Bonus 

In addition to the product work, I've been working on some interesting visualizations to think up some alternatives ways to jump into my twittersphere

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">been doing some EDA on my twitter follows today... what are y&#39;all up to anyway</p>&mdash; Nick Torba (@nicktorba) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktorba/status/1537863358497624067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 17, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


I'm going in search of answers to questions like: 
* who is active online today? 
* who is likley to engage with me? 
* what would a twitter tavern/landscape view look like? 
* who is having deep converstaions? what are they talking about? 


If you find any of that work intersting, or have any ideas for new visualizations I should try out, [DM me](https://twitter.com/nicktorba)!
