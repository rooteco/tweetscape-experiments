## Product Workshop Second Half 
In my [last post](https://tweetscape.co/blog/productupdate-06-24-2022), I shared that we were at halftime of a product workshop run by Ricardo and Julian. The goal of the workshop is to converge on a target customer persona and set of problems that will shape the path of what we decide to build.  

To prepare for the second half, each team member took the "how might we" questions written in the first half, re-configured them into our own product offerings, then pitched to the team. 

After that, we compared our pitches, analyzed the alignments and misalignments, converged to a selected path, and started to plan our next steps.

I'll describe each of those steps below. 

## Pitches
We each created our pitches in the team's shared miro board. I'm going to share screenshots of the pitches from each team member. 

#### Julian 
Julian's pitch is to transform feeds into more configurable views based on a combination of sources, streams and views.

#### Ricardo 
Ricardo went with more of a landing page approach to frame his product.

#### Torba
The depth of Julian and Ricardo's pitches show why we are so excited to have them on the team. Especially when compared to my own... 

My pitch builds on an idea that is similar to Julian's streams with help from others. Streams are similar to [Lucerne](https://thesephist.com/posts/lucerne/) style channels, where you have more control over the type of content that shows up your stream.

#### Rhys 
Rhys was more focused on a networked view of twitter. My man loves his networks.

## Alignment
As you can tell, our pitches were aligned around the same pain points: 
1. Lack of agency (agency ~= control over the information shown in a feed)
2. Lists suck, but they are one of the only tools available to increase agency 

This alignment allowed for us to quickly move on to the next section, which was deciding which persona to focus on. 

## Disagreements
Some of the team wanted to focus on analysts, while others wanted to build for analysts and deep thinkers simultaneously. 

The argument for analysts is that they are extremely online, have a higher willingness to learn new tools, and have a higher willingness to pay. Plus, many deep thinkers already want to spend less time on twitter, so they are less likely to spend time learning another tool on top of twitter. 

Despite the drawbacks of building for deep thinkers, the other half of the team still wanted to build a tool for them as well as analysts. Building for both will force us to keep the experience as simple, fun, and non-technical as possible, while still requiring enough power for analysts to have confidence in the results. We also don’t know the full market size of either persona, so starting with both and letting feedback guide us feels like a smart play. If the solutions we build don't resonate with either group, we can re-evaluate the decision later. 

Our thinking is shown in the figure below: 

![converging paths](/ss/product-workshop-second-half/converging-paths.png)

My initial opinion was that we should focus on analysts, but I was swayed by Ricardo and Julian’s arguments to build for both. 

The green dots represent votes by the participants in the workshop. You can see that most of the team was swayed to build for both analysts and deep thinkers. Afterall, both of our [previous](https://tweetscape.co/blog/rpg-vs-research) [posts](https://tweetscape.co/blog/productupdate-06-24-2022) showed enormous overlap in jobs to be done (JTBD) for each of these personas, so it makes sense that we can likely complete those jobs with the same tool. We will find out for sure as we begin to prototype. 


## Our Selected Path
With the decision shown in the image above, we determined our selected path: 

> Build a probing and surfacing app with sources, streams, and views for analysts and deep thinkers. 

This vision will be refined, but it encompasses the main point of what we are going to build. 
The goal is to give users a stronger sense of control over their feeds, especially when they want to explore new topics without spending hours/weeks figuring out who to follow and what to read. 

#### Media Codes Humans

The Tweetscape team takes our information environments very seriously. We know that the information we are exposed to shapes our lives - it can enrich them or deplete them. 

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">&quot;the people you follow have write access to your brain&quot; -<a href="https://twitter.com/repost_offender?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@repost_offender</a> <a href="https://t.co/Xrf0Kcgs9O">https://t.co/Xrf0Kcgs9O</a></p>&mdash; Nick Torba (@nicktorba) <a href="https://twitter.com/nicktorba/status/1540429673074757633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 24, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Tweetscape will be a tool that gives users more control over the media encoding they are exposed to.  

## Next Steps - Validation Plan

Now that we have a path, it is time to validate the our collective hypothesis. 
We are going to do this with a combination of illustrations, mockups, landing pages, prototypes, and background technical validation. 
Our rough validation outline is shown in the image below: 

![validation plan](/ss/product-workshop-second-half/validation-plan.png)

* Starting lofi - artifacts from the workshop, illustrations, and mockups 
    * Start work on technical validation as necessary
* Turn this into landing pages that communicate our most promising ideas 
    * Include videos and mockups of the UX 
* Move towards clickable prototypes
    * With more technical validation on the backend 

In future posts, I will share more concrete ideas about what sources, streams, and views could look like, and how we might be able to curate them collaboratively instead of on our own. 

For now, we will get to work on validation!
